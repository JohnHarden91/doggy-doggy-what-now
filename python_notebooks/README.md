# Data Notebooks Page

Main: This directory will be storage for any and all Python notebook used (either using Jupyter Notebooks or Google Collab).

This directory is organized by project direction with three directories:
1. `national_data` is the directory that contains the "macro-level" EDA from data collected from The National Database.
2. `time_dependent_modeling` is the directory that contains time-specific EDA and modeling efforts.
3. `time_independent_modeling` is the directory that contains EDA and modeling regarding classification-based efforts.
