## The Project
![image Image from "https://lifelineanimal.org/state-of-the-shelters/"](./images/for_markdown_files/state-of-the-shelters-blog-post-header.jpg)

The main question posed by our group is whether one can predict the rates of intake and/or adoption of dogs in animal shelters based on certain socioeconmic or cultural criteria.


### Macro-Level Data: 
A three-year aggregate of data was collected from The Shelter Animals Count: The National Database (https://www.shelteranimalscount.org) collected for all 50 states and Puerto Rico.

### Metro-Level Data: 
Data from multiple metropolitan locations were collected and cleaned. In particular:
- Sonoma County, California
- Austin, TX
- Bloomington County, Indiana
- Lexington, KY

### Additional Factors
A series of socioeconmic and cultural touchstones were explored to improve our modeling efforts. These include:
- Unemployment
- Stock prices
- Popular media (e.g. programs such as 'Bojack Horseman' or 'Bluey')
- Seasons and temperature
and more.

### Glossary of Terms
