# Doggy Doggy! ... now what?

## The Project

The main question posed by our group is whether one can predict the rates of intake and/or adoption of dogs in animal shelters based on certain socioeconmic or cultural criteria.

Basic Terminology:
"Intake": The factors in which a dog has been placed into an animal shelter.
These factors include: strays and/or abandoned dogs; public assistance; owner surrender (multiple reasons)

"Outcome": The factors in which a dog has left an animal shelter.
These factors include: adopted; returned to owner; lost or stolen; euthanized

### Macro-Level Data: 
A three-year aggregate of data was collected from The Shelter Animals Count: The National Database (https://www.shelteranimalscount.org) collected for all 50 states and Puerto Rico.

### Micro-Level Data: 
Data from three locations were collected and cleaned: Sonoma County in California; Austin, TX; and Bloomington County in Indiana

### Additional Factors
A series of socioeconmic and cultural touchstones were explored to improve our modeling efforts. These include:
- Unemployment
- Stock prices
- Popular media (e.g. Bojack Horseman, Bluey)
- Temperature
and more.
